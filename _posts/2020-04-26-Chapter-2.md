## Disclaimer

Below are my solutions to the end of chapter exercises in Statistical
Rethinking by Richard McElreath.

These results might not be correct, in particular, 2H4 gave me
difficulties. If you catch any errors or mistakes please leave a comment
below.

## 2M1:

First we’ll start off by defining our grid and prior, just make sure the
amount of times you repeat the prior is equal to the lenght.out.

Defining the likelihoods uses the dbinom() which stands for density
binomial distribution. We start by inputing how many observations were
‘waters’, the size is equal to the total number of tosses, and prob is
equal to our grid.

Comupting the posterior is the product of our likelihood and prior
divided by the sum of all those values.

``` r
# Define the grid
p_grid <- seq(from=0, to=1, length.out = 1000)

# Assume a uniform prior 
prior1 <- rep(1, 1000)

# Get the likelihood given: 3 waters and 3 tosses
#                           3 waters and 4 tosses
#                           5 waters and 7 tosses
likelihood1 <- dbinom(3, size=3, prob=p_grid)
likelihood2 <- dbinom(3, size=4, prob=p_grid)
likelihood3 <- dbinom(5, size=7, prob=p_grid)

# Compute posterior
posterior1 <- likelihood1 * prior1
posterior2 <- likelihood2 * prior1
posterior3 <- likelihood3 * prior1

# Standardize
posterior1 <- posterior1 / sum(posterior1)
posterior2 <- posterior2 / sum(posterior2)
posterior3 <- posterior3 / sum(posterior3)

# Plotting the posteriors
plot(p_grid, posterior1, type = "b",
     xlab = "probability of water",
     ylab = "posterior probability")
lines(p_grid, posterior2, type = "b", col = "red")
lines(p_grid, posterior3, type = "b", col = "blue")
legend("topleft", 
       c("posterior1", "posterior2", "posterior3"),
       fill = c("black", "red", "blue"))
mtext("1000 points")
```

## 2M2:

This problem is identical to the one above, the only thing that’s
changed is that we now our prior, instead of being uniform, is 0 when p
\< 0.5 and 1 otherwise. This can all be done in r using the ifelse()
function.

![](/assets/images/exercise_1.png)<!-- -->

## 2M3:

Since earth is 70% water then there’s only a 30% or 0.3 chance that it
will land on ‘land’. Mars has a 100% or 1.0 chance of landing on ‘land’
if tossed.

Below are two identical ways of solving the problem, the second was
included in case it’s not as clear how the code in the first part works.

``` r
ways <- c(.3, 1)
probability <- ways/sum(ways)
probability[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.2307692

``` r
# Alternative way
earth_land = 1-.7
mars_land = 1
probability_earth = earth_land/(earth_land + mars_land)
probability_earth
```

    ## [1] 0.2307692

## 2M4:

For the following set of questions I’ll be using \[bb\], \[bw\], and
\[ww\] to refer to a card that is black on boths sides, black on one
side/ white on the other, and white on both sides.

If \[bb\] is picked there’s a 100% or 1.0 chance that when it’s put on
the table a black side is facing up. If \[bw\] is picked it’s a 50% or
0.5 chance. If \[ww\] is picked there’s a 0% chance that a black side
can be facing up.

Another way of thinking about it is there are two ways a \[bb\] card can
show a black side up, only one way a \[bw\] card can, and no ways for a
\[ww\] card.

``` r
ways <- c(1, 0.5, 0)
probability <- ways/sum(ways)
probability[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.6666667

``` r
# ways <- c(2, 1, 0)
# p <- ways/sum(ways)
# p[1]
```

## 2M5:

Now there is an extra \[bb\] card. I like thinking about this in terms
of percentages, so there are two cards that have a 100% chance of
showing a black side face up, everything else is the same from 2M4.

Alternatively, as in 2M4, you can think of it as there are two ways a
\[bb\] card can show a black side face up, one way for a \[bw\] card, no
ways for \[ww\], and again two ways for the second \[bb\] card. Since we
can pick either of the \[bb\] cards we add their probabilities together
to get the final result.

``` r
ways <- c(2*1, 0.5, 0)
probability <- ways/sum(ways)
probability[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
# ways <- c(2, 1, 0, 2)
# probability <- ways/sum(ways)
# sum(probability[1], probability[4])
```

## 2M6:

Now we are informed that for every way we can pull \[bb\] there are two
ways we can pull \[bw\] and three ways to pull \[ww\]. In the previous
examples we were making the implicit assumption that there were equal
chances of drawing each card meaning that our prior was uniform, i.e. 1
for each card. Now we need to adjust our probability given this new
prior.

``` r
# You could also use: ways <- c(2, 1, 0)
ways <- c(1, 0.5, 0)
prior <- c(1, 2, 3)
likelihood <- ways * prior 
probability <- likelihood/sum(likelihood)
probability[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.5

## 2M7:

To solve this problem we’ll look at all the possible combinations of
draws that can lead to a black side showing face up on the first draw
followed by a white side showing up on the second. Since a \[bb\] card
has two ways it can show a black side face up, I will introduce a new
notation \[Bb\] and \[bB\] to represent the two different states of the
same card. The same logic will be applied to \[ww\], \[bw\] need not
change because there’s only one way a \[bw\] card can show either black
or white.

| First Draw | Second Draw |
| :--------: | :---------: |
|     Bb     |     bw      |
|     Bb     |     Ww      |
|     Bb     |     wW      |
|     bB     |     bw      |
|     bB     |     Ww      |
|     bB     |     wW      |
|     bw     |     Ww      |
|     bw     |     wW      |

From this we can see that there are six ways a \[bb\] card can be picked
first, and only two ways for the \[bw\] card to be picked first. There
are still no ways a \[ww\] could be picked first.

``` r
ways <- c(6, 2, 0)
probability <- ways/sum(ways)
probability[1]
```

## 2H1:

The relevant information here is that the probability of a panda giving
birth to twins given that it’s from species A is 10% and species B is
20%. Also, that both species of panda are equally common so. From this
we know the following:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28twins%20%7C%20A%29%20%3D%200.1%5C%5C%20Pr%28twins%20%7C%20B%29%20%3D%200.2%5C%5C%20Pr%28A%29%20%3D%20Pr%28B%29%20%3D%200.5%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)<!-- -->

Using Bayes Theorem we can find the following:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28A%20%7C%20twins%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BPr%28twins%20%7C%20A%29*Pr%28A%29%7D%7BPr%28twins%29%7D%5C%5C%20Pr%28A%20%7C%20twins%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B0.1*0.5%7D%7B0.1*0.5&plus;0.2*0.5%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

``` r
likelihood <- c(0.1, 0.2)
prior <- c(1,1)
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior/sum(posterior)
posterior[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.3333333

From this we know that

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28B%20%7C%20twins%29%20%3D%201%20-%20Pr%28A%20%7C%20twins%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

Now we can calculate Pr(twins)

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28twins%29%20%3D%20Pr%28twins%7CA%29*P%28A%29%20&plus;%20Pr%28twins%7CB%29*Pr%28B%29%5C%5C%20%3D%200.1*%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%20&plus;%200.2*%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%5C%5C%20%3D%200.1667%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

``` r
0.1*posterior[1]+0.2*posterior[2]
```

    ## [1] 0.1666667

## 2H2:

We actually already computed this in our solution above:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28A%20%7C%20twins%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BPr%28twins%20%7C%20A%29*Pr%28A%29%7D%7BPr%28twins%29%7D%5C%5C%20Pr%28A%20%7C%20twins%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B0.1*0.5%7D%7B0.1*0.5&plus;0.2*0.5%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

``` r
posterior[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.3333333

## 2H3:

Since we know the probability of each species giving birth to twins, we
can assume that the probability of giving birth to a singleton is just
the complement of our previous probabilities. Therefore:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28singleton%7CA%29%20%3D%200.9%5C%5C%20Pr%28singleton%20%7C%20B%29%20%3D%200.8%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

Since we’re assuming that the first birth were twins, we can reuse our
probabilities for A and B. 

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28A%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5C%5C%20Pr%28B%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

Now we can use Bayes Theorem again to solve the problem:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28A%20%7C%20singleton%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BPr%28singleton%7CA%29*Pr%28A%29%7D%7BPr%28singleton%29%7D%20%5C%5C%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B0.9*%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%7D%7B0.9*%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%20&plus;%200.8*%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D%20%5C%5C%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B0.3%7D%7B0.3%20&plus;%200.8333%7D%20%5C%5C%20%3D%200.36%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

``` r
likelihood <- c(0.9, 0.8)
prior <- c(1/3, 2/3)
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior/sum(posterior)
posterior[1]
```

    ## [1] 0.36

## 2H4:

I want to preface that this question gave me some trouble, I’ll do my
best to explain my thought process but if anyone has any feedback please
let me know.

We know that the probability this test correctly identifies a panda from
species A is 0.8, we also know that the probability that this test
correctly identifies a panda from species B is 0.65. I’ve included the
following type error chart to help visualize the
test.

![](/assets/images/ch2_type_errors.png)<!-- -->

We can interpret this as

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28test%20%5Cspace%20says%20%5Cspace%20A%7C%20A%29%20%3D%200.8%20%5C%5C%20Pr%28test%20%5Cspace%20says%20%5Cspace%20B%20%7C%20B%29%20%3D%200.65%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

Since TP + FN = 1 and FP + TN = 1 we can see that

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bc%7D%20Pr%28test%5Cspace%20says%20%5Cspace%20A%7C%20B%29%20%3D%200.35%20%5C%5C%20Pr%28test%20%5Cspace%20says%20%5Cspace%20B%7C%20A%29%20%3D%200.2%20%5Cend%7Barray%7D)

I hope the chart above helps illustrate why this is the case. Now back
to the question. For the first part we will be ignoring the information
from the previous questions and focus on computing the posterior
probability that the panda is from species A given that the test results
say it’s species
A.

Now we will use the birth data
