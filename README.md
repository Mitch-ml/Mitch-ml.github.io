# README 
The template for this site was created by [peterewills][6].

This website will serve as an online resume/portfolio, tracking personal projects like
self teachings, but also musings on other topics not necessarily math related.

To build the site locally, do

	git clone https://github.com/peterewills/peterewills.github.io.git
	cd peterewills.github.io
    gem install bundler # to get the dependency manager that jekyll uses
	bundle update # to make sure all ruby gems are up to date
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	
Then navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to view the page.

For a more detailed guide on how the site was built, check out [the how-to post
on the blog][5]

Site is built in jekyll on top of [Minimal Mistakes][1]. Uses images from
[Unsplash][2].
