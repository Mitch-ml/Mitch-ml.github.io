# About Me

I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative
information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or
statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of
mathematics and computing, and that's where I like to play.

I've worked with [Stage 1 start-ups][1] and [Venture capital funds][2],
building models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. I mainly use R, but have experience in Python and SQL.

I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics from St. Lawrence University, where I did
[my thesis][3] on the Erdos Faber Lovasz conjecture. After
spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working at a young
startup where I got introduced to a range of topics in statistics and data analytics. Though, my primary focus was on using survival analysis to help predict customer churn. For more details, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or
take a look at [my resume][4]. 

I currently live in Litchfield, CT.

[^fnote2]: After graduating from St. Lawrence, I traveled out west in attempts
to become a professional rock climber, spending most of my time in Squamish, BC
and Bishop, CA.
